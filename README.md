This is a BlackJack game
The basic game logic is coded
Ace scores 1 if sum of cards > 21

deck is complete with all the colors, drawing a card from a deck makes it
unavailable for next draw

All the app logic is written with functions.

The code was written exclusively by me and I came up with all the solutions but
the challenge was inspired '100 days of code' bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

It's better to launch from terminal because it supports console clearing

TODO

1# documentation
2# interface. I think I will rewrite it in JS and make web UI. I don't think
doing it in tkinter makes a lot of sense
